## About This Project

As a passionate fan of the NBA, I've always been fascinated by the world of basketball. From the thrill of buzzer-beating shots to the excitement of championship showdowns.

This project reflects my love for the NBA and my desire to combine it with my interest in programming. By creating a simple CSV reader in C++, I aim to showcase my skills while also paying homage to one of my favorite pastimes.

# CSV Reader in C++

This is a simple CSV reader implemented in C++ that reads CSV files and displays the data in a tabular format, including a box around the data.

## Features

- Reads CSV files with comma as delimiter.
- Prints the data in a tabular format with a box around it.
- Properly aligns two-digit win/loss scores.

## Sample CSV File

You can use the provided sample CSV file `nba_regular_season_standings.csv` to test the program. The file contains NBA regular season standings data for both Western and Eastern conferences from 2023-2024 season.
